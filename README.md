# 311 Data Analysis of Baltimore City from Open Baltimore page
This is a part of data analysis done by me, which includes a part of the homework in it for Data Science in my coursework. Input data was very huge, so I have taken only a set of rows from it and worked on analysing only over that set.
Any further comments or feedbacks are appreciated.
